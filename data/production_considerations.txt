Deploying a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system in production requires careful engineering considerations.
Performance, reliability, and observability are critical factors that go beyond simple experimentation.

Chunk size and overlap must be chosen carefully. Smaller chunks improve retrieval precision but increase storage and indexing
costs. Larger chunks reduce the number of vectors but may introduce irrelevant context into the prompt.

Latency is another major concern. Embedding generation, vector search, and language model inference all add to response time.
Production systems often cache embeddings and use optimized vector indexes to meet latency requirements.

Monitoring is essential to detect hallucinations, retrieval failures, and degraded model performance. Logging retrieved
documents alongside generated answers helps engineers debug incorrect outputs.

Security and access control are also important. Many RAG systems operate on sensitive internal documents, so strict permission
checks must be enforced at the retrieval layer.

In practice, LangChain is often combined with FastAPI for serving APIs, Docker for containerization, and cloud platforms such
as AWS or GCP for deployment. These components help ensure scalability and maintainability in real-world applications.
