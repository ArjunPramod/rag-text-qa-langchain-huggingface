Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently.
In the context of natural language processing, vectors usually represent embeddings generated from text using neural networks.

Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text. Sentences with similar meanings are mapped to vectors that are close to each
other in vector space. This allows systems to perform semantic search rather than relying on exact keyword matches.

FAISS is a popular open-source library developed by Meta for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
It is optimized for performance and can handle large-scale datasets with millions of vectors. FAISS supports various indexing
strategies that trade off accuracy and speed.

In RAG systems, vector databases like FAISS are used to retrieve the most relevant document chunks given a user query.
The quality of retrieval directly impacts the quality of the generated answer. If irrelevant chunks are retrieved, the model
may produce misleading or incomplete responses.

Other vector databases include Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Milvus. The choice of vector database depends on factors such as
dataset size, latency requirements, persistence needs, and deployment environment.
