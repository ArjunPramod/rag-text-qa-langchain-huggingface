LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
Rather than focusing on training or fine-tuning models, LangChain focuses on orchestration. Orchestration refers to the process
of connecting language models with external data sources, tools, memory, and application logic.

A key motivation behind LangChain is the limitation of standalone language models. LLMs are trained on large but fixed datasets
and do not have direct access to private documents, internal company knowledge, or real-time information. LangChain addresses
this limitation by allowing developers to plug in external data sources and retrieval systems.

LangChain provides abstractions for loading documents from various sources such as text files, PDFs, web pages, and databases.
These documents can then be transformed, split into chunks, embedded, and stored in vector databases for efficient retrieval.

Another important feature of LangChain is its support for prompt management. Instead of hardcoding prompts, developers can
define reusable prompt templates that clearly specify instructions, context, and expected outputs. This helps reduce
hallucinations and improves consistency.

LangChain also supports building conversational applications. By adding memory components, applications can remember past
user interactions, enabling multi-turn conversations. This is useful for chatbots, virtual assistants, and tutoring systems.

Overall, LangChain is best understood as an engineering framework. It does not replace machine learning fundamentals but
provides higher-level building blocks that allow engineers to turn language models into reliable, data-aware applications.
