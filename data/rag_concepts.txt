Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to improve the accuracy and reliability of language model outputs.
In a RAG system, the language model does not rely solely on its internal parameters to generate answers. Instead, it retrieves
relevant information from an external knowledge source and uses that information as context during generation.

The RAG pipeline typically consists of several steps. First, documents are collected from one or more data sources.
These documents are then split into smaller chunks to ensure that each piece of text fits within the model’s context window.
Next, embeddings are generated for each chunk using an embedding model.

When a user asks a question, the question itself is converted into an embedding. A similarity search is then performed between
the question embedding and the document embeddings to identify the most relevant chunks. These retrieved chunks are injected
into the prompt that is sent to the language model.

RAG helps reduce hallucinations because the model is constrained to generate answers based on retrieved context rather than
guessing from incomplete knowledge. However, RAG systems are only as good as their retrieval component. Poor chunking,
low-quality embeddings, or irrelevant documents can still lead to incorrect answers.

In real-world systems, RAG is widely used for document question answering, internal knowledge bases, customer support systems,
and enterprise search applications.
